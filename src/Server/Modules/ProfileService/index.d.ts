Changes made to `profileTemplate` can be applied to `Profile.Data` of previously saved profiles by calling [Profile.Reconcile()](https://madstudioroblox.github.io/ProfileService/api/#profilereconcile). You can also create your own function to fill in the missing components in `Profile.Data` as soon as it is loaded or have `nil` exceptions in your personal `.Get()` and `.Set()` method libraries.
